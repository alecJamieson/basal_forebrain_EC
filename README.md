Altered basal forebrain regulation of intrinsic brain networks in depressive and anxiety disorders (under review)
The repository contains group and individual participant effective connectivity data and the scripts used to generate figures for this paper.

This study investigated altered effective connectivity between basal forebrain subregions and key nodes of the default mode and salience networks in those with depressive and anxiety disorders. Through a combination of ultra-high field neuroimaging and dynamic causal modelling we identified that these changes were largely localised to the nucleus basalis of Meynert.
